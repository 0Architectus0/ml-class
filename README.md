# Setup

## Prerequisites

I try to make this class as easy to setup as possible.  You need to have python installed.  You can download python at https://www.python.org/downloads/.

The material should work with python 2 or 3.  If you don't know the difference I would install python 3.

### For people who haven't done a lot of programming

If you are uncomfortable opening up a terminal, I strongly recommend doing a quick tutorial before you take this class.  Setting up your machine can be painful but once you're setup you can get a ton out of the class.  I recommend getting started ahead of time.

If you're on Windows I recommend checking out http://thepythonguru.com/.

If you're on a Mac check out http://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac/coding-with-python-on-mac-3635912/

If you're on linux, you're probably already reasonably well setup :).

### For people who haven't done a lot of python

If you are comfortable opening up a terminal but want a python intro/refresher check out https://www.learnpython.org/ for a really nice introduction to Python.

### For people who are experts on python

A lot of people like to follow along with ipython or jupyter notebook and I think that's great!  I also really appreciate pull requests to make the code clearer.


## Libraries
Before the class, please run the following commands
```
pip install pandas
pip install scikit-learn
pip install tensorflow
pip install keras
```
## Check installation

To make sure your installation works go to the directory where this file is and run
```
python test-scikit.py
```

You should see the output "Scikit is installed!"

```
python test-keras.py
```

You should see the output "Using TensorFlow backend.  Keras is installed!"
